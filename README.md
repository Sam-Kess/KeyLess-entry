### Kelyless Entry for our building's door
Out main building door is old and we're lazy, we have a pattern that we buzz our apartment with to unlock the door.
An ESP32 is continueously looking for that pattern, once we do the right pattern `5 clicks within 2s and then one click after 3s` it engages a relay that unlocks out building door. We're definetly planning to add a BLE layer to it for further auth, but we're running into some logistical challenge that prevents us from doing so. But we'll have it soon.
